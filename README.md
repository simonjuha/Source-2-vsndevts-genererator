# Source-2-vsndevts-genererator
Used with Half life: Alyx (source 2 engine) to write a vsndevts file from a folder of wav (44100 sample rate) files.
When the script is run, it iterates all folders in the 'sounds/' folder. A .vsndevts file is written with found wav files.
For example a file with the path 'sounds/folder1/audio.wav' will be written in the .vsndevts file as folder1.audio. I use this as a easy way to make sound events.
